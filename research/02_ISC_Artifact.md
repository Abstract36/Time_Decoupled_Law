# Artifact Declaration v1
## Irrevocable Silence Commitment (ISC)

**Status**: Frozen / Canonical

### 0. Document Status
This document:
*   Declares a protocol artifact.
*   Does not describe a product.
*   Does not suggest validation.
*   Does not imply evolution.
It fixes an immutable law.

### 1. Declaration
We declare the existence of a protocol artifact of class:
**Time–Absence State Machine (TASM)**
with the canonical form:
**Irrevocable Silence Commitment (ISC)**

### 2. Ontological Definition
**Irrevocable Silence Commitment** is an artifact where the **absence of action** before a fixed moment in time is the final and irreversible decision of the protocol.
Silence is considered not as an absence of information, but as a positive fact determining the outcome.

### 3. Law Formulation
If subject does not perform action $D$ before time $T$, then outcome $O_0$ becomes true forever, and alternative outcome $O_1$ becomes impossible.

Format:
$$ \text{If } \neg D \text{ before } T \Rightarrow \text{Outcome} := O_0 \text{ forever} $$

This law:
*   Requires no execution.
*   Allows no delays.
*   Allows no exceptions.

### 4. Principal Properties
**4.1 Inevitability**
After time $T$, the outcome cannot be undetermined.

**4.2 Irreversibility**
A fixed outcome:
*   Cannot be cancelled.
*   Cannot be reviewed.
*   Cannot be compensated.

**4.3 Non-Intervention**
There exists no subject, instruction, or procedure capable of changing the outcome after the deadline.

**4.4 Lazy but Mandatory Recognition**
Physical recognition of the outcome may be delayed, but logically it is already true.

### 5. Role of Time and Silence
In ISC:
*   Time is the source of truth.
*   Silence is an action.
*   Absence of activity has legal and protocol force.

### 6. Relation to Participants
**Participants** cannot:
*   Extend the deadline.
*   Request forgiveness.
*   Change the decision.

**Developers** cannot:
*   Fix the outcome.
*   Introduce upgrades.
*   Add exceptions.

**Governance / DAO** cannot:
*   Review the result.
*   Implement an override.
*   Mitigate consequences.

### 7. Economic and Operational Status
ISC:
*   Is not a service.
*   Is not an intermediary.
*   Does not hold custody.

It requires no:
*   Operators.
*   Interfaces.
*   Support.
*   Trust.

### 8. Final Fixation
The **Irrevocable Silence Commitment** is declared, anchored, and frozen.
Silence has the force of law.

*If time has passed, and the action is not performed, the outcome is strictly determined.*
